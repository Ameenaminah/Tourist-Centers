          <h3>The most popular tourist destination in Nigeria</h3>
          <p>
            Obudu Mountain Resort is a ranch and resort in Cross River State
            developed in 1951 by M. McCaughley, a Scot who first explored the
            mountain ranges in 1949. Formerly known as the Obudu Cattle Ranch,
            Obudu Mountain Resort has in recent times recorded visits from both
            Nigerian and international tourists because of the development of
            the facilities by Cross-River State Government, which has turned the
            ranch into a well-known holiday and tourist resort centre in Niger.

                Kayaking is a great way to spend oneâ€™s day. Along with a few
                other people, you sit in boat and paddle along the beautiful
                cliffs of Lagos.

                Yankari is composed of savannah grassland with patches of
                woodland, hills of different heights, natural warm water
                springs, as well as a wide variety of flora and fauna.
